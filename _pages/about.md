The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 169 Targets and 232 unique (244 with duplicate) indicators. SGDs are built upon the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and are an urgent call for actions by all countries – regardless of their situation - in a global partnership. These Goals recognise that ending poverty and other deprivations must go together with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests (United Nations, 2019).
