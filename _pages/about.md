The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 169 Targets and 232 unique (244 with duplicate) indicators. SGDs are built upon the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and are an urgent call for actions by all countries – regardless of their situation - in a global partnership. These Goals recognise that ending poverty and other deprivations must go together with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests (United Nations, 2019).

Agenda 2030 further, embodies the belief that development can be best pursued by addressing interrelated economic, social and environmental issues. The 2030 Agenda commits to **‘_leaving no one behind_ '** and including the most vulnerable groups in a society. Therefore, the focus is placed on the disaggregation level of the indicators concerning vulnerable groups such as children, youth, people with disabilities, indigenous groups, refugees etc.

## UN SDGs Indicators Framework

An Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDGs Indicators (IEAG-SDGs) agreed upon the global indicator framework to monitor progress on the 17 Goals. The 244 indicators of the SDGs can be quantified as constituting of 50 indicators aimed at monitoring the “means of implementation” (speaking to policy implementation) and 194 “goal indicators” to quantify the progress made in the country. 
The IAEG-SDGs further, classifies the indicators into three tiers by their level of methodological development and the availability of data at the global level as follows:

'''(i)	**Tier 1:** Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 % of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant.'''
'''(ii)	**Tier 2:** Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but data are not regularly produced by countries.'''
'''(iii)**Tier 3:** No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested.'''
